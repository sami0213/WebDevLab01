about_me = "Hi! I‚Äôm Sami Norris, and I'm a Biology major on the pre-med track with big dreams of scrubbing into orthopedic surgery and owning my own practice one day. I love exploring how the human body works (and occasionally wondering how mine runs on so little sleep). I‚Äôm passionate about science, fascinated by weird medical facts, and always up for a challenge, whether it‚Äôs in the lab, the classroom, or just trying to convince myself I don‚Äôt need another cup of coffee. When I‚Äôm not studying or working, you‚Äôll probably find me sleeping or reorganizing my calander again."
